Private library

The Private Library system is a Java-based application designed to assist individuals who frequently lend books or
other similar content (magazines, newspapers) to manage their private libraries effectively.

Main functions of the application:

* User registration and authentication: users can create accounts and log in with different roles,
such as “guest” or “librarian”. Librarians have additional privileges, such as managing lending requests and reservations,
adding/removing books.

* Book Management: ♥ Add books to the library with the details like title, author, publication date, genre,
content summary and picture of the book.  + remove books from Library.                                                                                                                                                                       ♥ User-provided assessments or reviews for each book, as well as possibility of reservation and lending by user.

* Library status overview: display a list of all books in the Library
(and showing which books are currently available, which are lent out, which are reserved).
